<strong>Tab Containers – Keep your internet browsing separate!</strong>

Maintain your privacy & security! Don't allow malicious companies like Google and Amazon to track your web browsing across the internet!
Tab Containers isolates browser tracking data (cookies, local storage, etc.), exposing this data only to tabs in that container.
This allows you to log in to multiple different email accounts on the same browser, for example your work/school and personal email.
You can even configure different VPN and proxy settings per each container for ultimate privacy.

Tab Containers is a fork of <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/">Firefox Multi-Account Containers</a> with some additional features/bug fixes that Mozilla has decided not to implement.

This extension will always be maintained up-to-date with the current version of Firefox Multi-Account Containers (until it isn't). For nerds, the <a href="https://github.com/hwknsj/tab-containers" target="_blank">source code is available on Github</a>.

The Tab Containers extension lets you carve out a separate box for each of your online lives – no more opening a different browser just to check your work email! Here is a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv=Gy7lyvAfOSw">quick video</a> showing you how it works.

Under the hood, Tab Containers separates website storage (cookies, history, local & session storage) into isolated tabs, or groups of tabs, which only share with other tabs of the same group. Cookies and other data of one group are not available to other container groups. This allows you to sign into multiple accounts on the same site (e.g. your personal Gmail as well as your work Gmail/GSuite).

An incredibly powerful feature of Tab Containers is the ability to configure unique SOCKS5/HTTP(S) proxy settings, or integrate Mozilla VPN (with different configurations) <em>for each tab container group</em>. This way, you can protect your home IP/Geolocation/encrypt connections to <em>some</em> websites, while using your true IP/location/connection for others.
This is extremely useful, for example, if you wish to watch Netflix or HBO Max or Hulu while protecting your identity while browsing, shopping, or reading other websites likely to track and abuse your information by using a secure proxy and/or Mozilla VPN.
This is also useful for developers who may wish to reroute or intercept their traffic via a proxy <strong>without the need to set a system-wide proxy</strong>.

Other features of Tab Containers include:

<ul>
  <li>Sign in to two different accounts on the same site; for example, sign in to work email and home email in
    two different Container tabs–no need to install two different browsers or use Incognito mode!</li>
  <li>Visually and logically separate different types of web browsing: keep your online banking far away from your work-related websites, and keep your work logins & browsing even further from your "NSFW" browsing.</li>
  <li>Prevent & defeat social-network tracking: sites like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, use aggressive tracking techniques to identify and record your internet browsing activity, beyond the social network itself, to sell your consumer profile (your history, interests, web searches, political beliefs, purchases, etc.) to corporations, political groups, government organizations (without your consent or knowledge). Using a separate "social network" container group and another for other web browsing prevents this type of tracking entirely <em>while giving you the power to decide to share this information</em>.</li>
  <li>Avoid sophisticated "fingerprinting" (i.e. identification) techniques which are often used across different websites to target individuals by isolating the sites you browse and prevent leaking data, and even browse from different locations (IP addresses) with Mozilla VPN.</li>
  <li>Protect your browsing activity & access region-restricted content while also accessing sites that require connection from your home country. For example, listen to USA-restricted artists on Spotify, watch YouTube videos only available in UK/EU, view UK streaming services such as BBC / Channel 4, ESPN+, and Disney+, in different browser tabs, and still be able to check your bank account, use your local government's web services, or work from home.</li>
</ul>

After installing the Tab Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your

tab.
